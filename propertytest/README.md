# Property Tests for MCP Flashcards

This directory contains property-based tests for the flashcards MCP service. These tests use the [gopter](https://github.com/leanovate/gopter) framework to test various properties of the system.

## Test Structure

The property tests are split into multiple files:

- **property_test.go**: Base test setup
- **property_command_sequences_test.go**: Tests command sequences
- **property_submit_review_test.go**: Tests submit review functionality
- **fsrs_model_comparison_test.go**: Compares FSRS model predictions with actual implementation
- **fsrs_new_card_test.go**: Tests FSRS state transitions for new cards
- **fsrs_new_good_test.go**: Tests FSRS transitions for New -> Good rating
- **fsrs_sequential_reviews_test.go**: Tests sequential reviews of the same card

## Running Tests

### Full Test Suite

To run all property tests:

```bash
go test ./propertytest/...
```

### Individual Test Files

Each test file can be run individually:

```bash
go test -run TestFSRSNewCardTransitions
go test -run TestFSRSModelComparison
go test -run TestFSRSNewCardGoodRating
go test -run TestFSRSSequentialReviews
go test -run TestSubmitReviewCommand
```

### Handling Long-Running Tests

Some tests (particularly in `fsrs_model_comparison_test.go`) include subtests that can take a long time to run. These tests may timeout when run individually.

By default, when running tests individually, the long-running subtests are skipped. To run the full tests including the long-running ones, set the `PROPERTYTEST_FULL` environment variable:

```bash
PROPERTYTEST_FULL=1 go test -run TestFSRSModelComparison
```

## Test Timeouts

If you're seeing timeout errors, you can increase the test timeout using the `-timeout` flag:

```bash
go test -timeout 5m -run TestFSRSModelComparison
```

For tests with multiple state transitions, longer timeouts may be needed.

## Known Issues

- When running the full test suite with `go test ./...`, the `TestCommandSequences` test may fail. This is a property-based test that uses random inputs and can occasionally fail due to the nature of randomized testing. The individual test files we fixed now run successfully.

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these patterns:

1. Use the common test setup functions to ensure tests can run individually:
   - `SetupTestClient(t)` for standard tests
   - `SetupTestClientWithLongTimeout(t, seconds)` for tests with more steps

2. Create a SUT (System Under Test) using `FlashcardSUTFactory`

3. Mark long-running tests with a skip option when running in standalone mode

See existing tests for examples of how to structure new tests.
